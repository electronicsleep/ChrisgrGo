       <p class="lead">Started my journy on the Apple platform after they adopted the UNIX core for MacOS and bought my first macbook for creative, programming and system work in college. I am amazed at the creative software written for the Mac platform and the creative developers. I started learning about Objective C after buying my first Mac and now learning Swift.

       <p class="lead">Some of my favorite software for the mac are Reason, Logic, Final Cut and Pixelmator, I have written many songs with Reason for my music projects. It's nice to have a UNIX terminal, great open source software and all the creative software available right next to each other.

       <p class="lead">While working at Apple I dicided to buy an iPad for music and art. I use the iPad for a sequencer, soft synths and drawing. When I moved to the SF Bay Area I worked at Apple on the iCloud team after taking a couple of short term projects.

       <p class="lead">Currently working on MacOS/iOS apps for music projects and DevOps. I have also written some education software that works on the mac. I try to make sure every software I write is tested on Apple and Linux platforms.
