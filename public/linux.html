       <p class="lead">I would say my favorite thing about Linux is programming on the platform. Recently I have been learning graphics with SDL2/OpenGL and different graphics under Linux. I graviated towards the platform due to the command line and the vast information about programming and knowledge available.

       <p class="lead">I use Debian and Ubuntu GNU/Linux nowadays. I started off with slackware as my first distro around 1998. Somtiemes at work I use RedHat/Oracle/CentOS Linux. I use the following programming languages: Go, Python, Rust, Java, and PHP. Most my projects involve Linux.
