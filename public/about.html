        <p class="lead">Hello my name is Chris I am a software engineer and musician in the SF Bay Area.

	<hr>
        <p class="lead">Born in Arizona and moved to the SF Bay Area in 2011. I work as a software engineer and enjoy playing music with my free time. I play bass guitar, drums, keyboard and synths and enjoy doing other things like drawing, learning graphics, programming and making electronic music. Started playing bass guitar and using a drum machine in 1994.

        <p class="lead">In 2019 I became a new dad to a wonderful girl Ella. She has inspired me to look at things a bit differently than before and take more time to understand the whys in life. We have already started building some things and drawing together and writing some Python.

        <p class="lead">One thing that has remained a constant is learning new technology and ideas I am always open to challenging myself to find better ways of doing things.
