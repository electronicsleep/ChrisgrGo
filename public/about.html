        <p class="lead">Born in Arizona and moved to the SF Bay Area in 2011. I work as a software engineer and play bass guitar, sometimes guitar and keyboard and synths and enjoy doing other things like drawing, learning graphics, programming and making electronic music. Started playing bass guitar and using a drum machine in 1994. 

        <p class="lead">I am a new dad to a wonderful baby girl Ella. She has inspired me to look at things a bit differently than before and take more time to understand the whys in life. We have already started building some things and drawing together.
