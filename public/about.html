        <p class="lead">Born in Arizona and moved to the SF Bay Area in 2011. I work as a software engineer and play bass guitar and synth, learn graphics programming, making electronic music and learning creative computing. Started playing bass guitar and using a drum machine in 1994. I am a new dad to a wonderful baby girl Ella.
