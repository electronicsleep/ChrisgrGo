        <p class="lead">Born in Arizona and moved to the SF Bay Area in 2011. I work as a software engineer and enjoy playing bass guitar, learning graphics programming and making electronic music and learning about the creative side of computing. Started playing bass guitar and using a drum machine in 1994.
